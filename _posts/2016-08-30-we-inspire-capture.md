## The Basics

All you have to do is sync a device, such as a cell phone or an ipad, to the system using the local network. Once this is done you can pull up a pre-existing photo or take a new one on the big screen.

## Collaboration

Capture is best utilized when it is integrated with the other we-inspire applications as it seamlessly interact with both the sketch and brainstorm applications. Once you have it on the big screen you can add it to an open project. Just copy and paste the image into brainstorm or sketch and get customizing.
